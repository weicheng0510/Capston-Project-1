| Design Database schema      | Determine the models and database schema required for your project.                                           | [Database Schema](https://github.com/hatchways-community/capstone-project-one-20728c883007461b8817ae5cc118f032/issues/2)                                                 |
| Source Your Data            | Determine where your data will come from. You may choose to use an existing API or create your own.           | [Data Source](https://github.com/hatchways-community/capstone-project-one-20728c883007461b8817ae5cc118f032/issues/3)                                                     |
| User Flows                  | Determine user flow(s) - think about what you want a user’s experience to be like as they navigate your site. | [User Flows](https://github.com/hatchways-community/capstone-project-one-20728c883007461b8817ae5cc118f032/issues/4)                                                      |
| Set up backend and database | Configure the environmental variables on your framework of choice for development and set up database.        | Supabase / postgreSQL                                                                                                                                                    |
| Set up frontend             | Set up frontend framework of choice and link it to the backend with a simple API call for example.            | Flask with Jinja2 templates                                                                                                                                              |
| User Authentication         | Fullstack feature - ability to authenticate (login and sign up) as a user                                     | User will be able to login and sign up on the frontend by entering username and password. If successful logged in or signed up, user will be authenticated and logged in |

## Labeling

Labeling is a great way to separate out your tasks and to track progress. Here’s an [example](https://github.com/hatchways/sb-capstone-example/issues) of a list of issues that have labels associated.

| Label Type    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Example                      |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Difficulty    | Estimating the difficulty level will be helpful to determine if the project is unique and ready to be showcased as part of your portfolio - having a mix of task difficultlies will be essential.                                                                                                                               | Easy, Medium, Hard           |
| Type          | If a frontend/backend task is large at scale (for example: more than 100 additional lines or changes), it might be a good idea to separate these tasks out into their own individual task. If a feature is smaller at scale (not more than 10 files changed), labeling it as fullstack would be suitable to review all at once. | Frontend, Backend, Fullstack |
| Stretch Goals | You can also label certain tasks as stretch goals - as a nice to have, but not mandatory for completing this project.                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Must Have, Stretch Goal      |
